# nsx-perf

`nsx-perf` provides generic performance capture primitives for NSX bare-metal
apps.

Contents:
- DWT cycle/CPI/exception/sleep/LSU/fold counters
- cache snapshot and delta helpers where supported
- Apollo5/Apollo330 PC sampling and ITM/SWO helpers

The API is generic and does not depend on TFLM. Unsupported capabilities remain
unavailable on targets that do not expose the underlying hardware counters.
